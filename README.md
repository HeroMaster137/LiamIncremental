So, this is my first incremental game, Liam Incremental. It will most likely barely be interesting or balanced but I will try to keep making incrementals. I think I'm going to start small, with only a few layers, since I am new to HTML, CSS, and Javascript(planning on learning typescript in the future). I should get a website up in a short-ish time. Thanks for checking Liam Incremental out!
