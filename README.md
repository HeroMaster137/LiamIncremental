So, this is my first incremental game, Liam Incremental(don't pay attention to the name or any of the names on upgrades or anything in the game). It will most likely barely be interesting or balanced but I will try to keep making incrementals. I think I'm going to start small, with only a few layers, since I am new to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Thanks for checking Liam Incremental out!

Roadmap(Not detailed):
1. Toggles For Autobuy
2. Make it actually look good(this is gonna be a pain idk CSS)
3. New layer(told you it's not going to be detailed)
