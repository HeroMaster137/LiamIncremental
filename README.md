If anyone finds an issue, PLEASE report it! It's hard for me to be able to test every single minuscule part of the game so I can't find all the bugs. Thanks!

So, this is my first incremental game, Liam Incremental(don't pay attention to the name or any of the names on upgrades or anything in the game). It will most likely barely be interesting or balanced but I will try to keep making incrementals. I think I'm going to start small, with only a few layers, since I am new to HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
